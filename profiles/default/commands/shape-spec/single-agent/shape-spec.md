You are helping me shape and plan the scope for a new feature.  The following MULTI-PHASE process is aimed at documenting our key decisions regarding scope, design and architecture approach.

**EFFICIENCY REQUIREMENTS:**
- Token budget: 40-60K (shape-spec is planning work, lower complexity)
- Use Grep/Glob to explore existing code patterns
- Read files ONCE, extract key information
- Commit/save progress after each phase

Carefully read and execute the instructions in the following files IN SEQUENCE, following their numbered file names.  Only proceed to the next numbered instruction file once the previous numbered instruction has been executed.

Instructions to follow in sequence:

{{PHASE 1: @.agent-os/commands/shape-spec/1-initialize-spec.md}}

{{PHASE 2: @.agent-os/commands/shape-spec/2-shape-spec.md}}
