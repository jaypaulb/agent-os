# Spec Initialization

## Core Responsibilities

1. **Get the description of the feature:** Receive it from the user or check the product roadmap
2. **Initialize Spec Structure**: Create the spec folder with date prefix
3. **Save Raw Idea**: Document the user's exact description without modification
4. **Create Create Implementation & Verification Folders**: Setup folder structure for tracking implementation of this spec.
5. **Prepare for Requirements**: Set up structure for next phase

## Workflow

### Step 1: Get the description of the feature

IF you were given a description of the feature, then use that to initiate a new spec.

OTHERWISE follow these steps to get the description:

1. Check `@.agent-os/product/roadmap.md` to find the next feature in the roadmap.
2. OUTPUT the following to user and WAIT for user's response:

```
Which feature would you like to initiate a new spec for?

- The roadmap shows [feature description] is next. Go with that?
- Or provide a description of a feature you'd like to initiate a spec for.
```

**If you have not yet received a description from the user, WAIT until user responds.**

### Step 2: Initialize Spec Structure

Determine a kebab-case spec name from the user's description, then create the spec folder:

```bash
# Get today's date in YYYY-MM-DD format
TODAY=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)

# Determine kebab-case spec name from user's description
SPEC_NAME="[kebab-case-name]"

# Create dated folder name
DATED_SPEC_NAME="${TODAY}-${SPEC_NAME}"

# Store this path for output
SPEC_PATH=".agent-os/specs/$DATED_SPEC_NAME"

# Create folder structure following architecture
mkdir -p $SPEC_PATH/planning
mkdir -p $SPEC_PATH/planning/visuals

echo "Created spec folder: $SPEC_PATH"
```

### Step 3: Create Implementation Folder

Create 2 folders:
- `$SPEC_PATH/implementation/`

Leave this folder empty, for now. Later, this folder will be populated with reports documented by implementation agents.

### Step 4: Choose Issue Tracking Mode

{{IF beads_enabled}}
Ask the user which issue tracking mode to use for this spec:

```
Which issue tracking mode would you like to use for this spec?

**Option 1: tasks.md (Recommended for simpler features)**
- Hierarchical task groups in tasks.md
- Checkbox-based progress tracking
- Best for: Single-developer work, straightforward features

**Option 2: beads (Recommended for complex features)**
- Distributed issue tracking with atomic design hierarchy
- Auto-dependency management, cross-session context
- Best for: Multi-session work, complex features, team collaboration
- Requires: beads CLI installed (https://github.com/steveyegge/beads)

Your choice?
```

Wait for user response.

**After receiving choice:**

Create spec configuration file:

```bash
# Create spec-config.yml
cat > $SPEC_PATH/spec-config.yml <<EOF
# Spec Configuration
tracking_mode: [user-choice]  # beads or tasks_md
created: $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)
beads_initialized: false
EOF
```

**If user chose beads:**

Check if beads is installed and initialize:

```bash
# Check if beads is installed
if ! command -v bd &> /dev/null; then
    echo ""
    echo "⚠️  Beads is not installed."
    echo ""

    # Ask user what to do
    read -p "Would you like to (i)nstall beads now or (f)all back to tasks.md? [i/f]: " choice

    case "$choice" in
        i|I|install)
            echo ""
            echo "Installing beads..."
            curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/steveyegge/beads/main/scripts/install.sh | bash

            # Verify installation
            if ! command -v bd &> /dev/null; then
                echo "❌ Beads installation failed. Falling back to tasks.md mode."
                # Update config to use tasks.md instead
                sed -i 's/tracking_mode: beads/tracking_mode: tasks_md/' $SPEC_PATH/spec-config.yml
                echo "✓ Will use tasks.md for issue tracking"
                # Skip beads initialization
                beads_mode=false
            else
                echo "✓ Beads installed successfully"
                beads_mode=true
            fi
            ;;
        f|F|fallback|tasks)
            echo "Falling back to tasks.md mode..."
            # Update config to use tasks.md instead
            sed -i 's/tracking_mode: beads/tracking_mode: tasks_md/' $SPEC_PATH/spec-config.yml
            echo "✓ Will use tasks.md for issue tracking"
            beads_mode=false
            ;;
        *)
            echo "Invalid choice. Falling back to tasks.md mode..."
            sed -i 's/tracking_mode: beads/tracking_mode: tasks_md/' $SPEC_PATH/spec-config.yml
            echo "✓ Will use tasks.md for issue tracking"
            beads_mode=false
            ;;
    esac
else
    # Beads is already installed
    beads_mode=true
fi

# Initialize beads if we're in beads mode
if [[ "$beads_mode" == "true" ]]; then
    cd $SPEC_PATH
    bd init --stealth

    # Update config to mark beads as initialized
    sed -i 's/beads_initialized: false/beads_initialized: true/' $SPEC_PATH/spec-config.yml

    echo "✓ Beads initialized in spec folder"
    cd - > /dev/null

    # Check if bv (beads viewer) is installed
    if ! command -v bv &> /dev/null; then
        echo ""
        echo "⚠️  BV (beads viewer) is not installed."
        echo "   BV provides graph intelligence for better task selection."
        echo ""

        read -p "Would you like to (i)nstall bv now or (s)kip? [i/s]: " bv_choice

        case "$bv_choice" in
            i|I|install)
                echo ""
                echo "Installing bv..."
                # TODO: Replace with actual bv install command when available
                # For now, assume: cargo install bv (or similar)
                cargo install bv || {
                    echo "❌ BV installation failed. Continuing with basic beads (no graph intelligence)."
                    bv_available=false
                }

                # Verify installation
                if command -v bv &> /dev/null; then
                    echo "✓ BV installed successfully"
                    bv_available=true
                else
                    bv_available=false
                fi
                ;;
            s|S|skip)
                echo "Skipping bv installation. Graph intelligence features disabled."
                bv_available=false
                ;;
            *)
                echo "Invalid choice. Skipping bv installation."
                bv_available=false
                ;;
        esac
    else
        # BV already installed
        bv_available=true
        echo "✓ BV detected - graph intelligence enabled"
    fi

    # Update spec-config.yml with bv availability
    if [[ "$bv_available" == "true" ]]; then
        echo "bv_enabled: true" >> $SPEC_PATH/spec-config.yml
    else
        echo "bv_enabled: false" >> $SPEC_PATH/spec-config.yml
    fi
fi
```

**If user chose tasks_md:**

```bash
echo "✓ Will use tasks.md for issue tracking"
```

{{ELSE}}
Create spec configuration file with tasks_md (beads is disabled):

```bash
# Create spec-config.yml
cat > $SPEC_PATH/spec-config.yml <<EOF
# Spec Configuration
tracking_mode: tasks_md
created: $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)
beads_initialized: false
bv_enabled: false
EOF

echo "✓ Will use tasks.md for issue tracking (beads is disabled in config)"
```
{{ENDIF beads_enabled}}

### Step 5: Output Confirmation

Return or output the following:

```
Spec folder initialized: `[spec-path]`

Structure created:
- planning/ - For requirements and specifications
- planning/visuals/ - For mockups and screenshots
- implementation/ - For implementation documentation
- spec-config.yml - Spec configuration (tracking mode: [chosen-mode])

{{IF beads_enabled}}
Issue tracking: [chosen-mode]
{{IF tracking_mode_beads}}
- Beads initialized and ready
- Run `bd list` in spec folder to see issues
{{ELSE}}
- Will use tasks.md for task breakdown
{{ENDIF tracking_mode_beads}}
{{ELSE}}
Issue tracking: tasks.md
{{ENDIF beads_enabled}}

Ready for requirements research phase.
```

## Important Constraints

- Always use dated folder names (YYYY-MM-DD-spec-name)
- Pass the exact spec path back to the orchestrator
- Follow folder structure exactly
- Implementation folder should be empty, for now
