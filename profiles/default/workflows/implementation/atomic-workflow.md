# Atomic Design Workflow

This workflow defines the step-by-step process for implementing features using atomic design principles with specialized agents.

## Overview

Atomic design mandates building from smallest units upward:
1. **Atoms** (pure functions, constants, utilities)
2. **Molecules** (compositions of 2-3 atoms)
3. **Organisms** (complex feature units: database, API, UI layers)
4. **Pages** (composition roots, wiring, entry points)

Each level is handled by a specialized agent and must complete before the next level begins.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation - Atoms

### Agent: `atom-writer`

**Responsibility:** Create pure, single-responsibility atoms with zero peer dependencies.

**Workflow:**

1. **Analyze Requirements**
   - Read `spec.md` to identify needed atoms
   - Look for: validators, formatters, converters, calculations, constants
   - Reference `{{standards/global/atomic-design.md}}` for atom principles

2. **Find Ready Work**
   {{IF tracking_mode_beads}}
   ```bash
   # Find unblocked atom issues
   bd ready --type atom

   # Recover cross-session context
   bd list --json | jq '.[] | select(.assignee=="atom-writer" and .status=="in_progress")'
   ```
   {{ELSE}}
   - Read relevant task groups from `tasks.md`
   - Identify atom-level subtasks
   {{ENDIF tracking_mode_beads}}

3. **Implement Atoms**
   - Write pure functions with no side effects where possible
   - Single responsibility per atom
   - Zero dependencies on other atoms
   - Clear input/output contracts
   - Place in appropriate location (e.g., `utils/`, `lib/atoms/`, `helpers/`)

4. **Write Tests** (1-3 per atom)
   - Unit tests with pure input/output
   - Edge cases and boundary conditions
   - No mocking needed (atoms are pure)
   - Run tests: Ensure all pass

5. **Track Progress**
   {{IF tracking_mode_beads}}
   ```bash
   # Mark in progress
   bd update [atom-id] --status in_progress

   # If discover new atoms needed
   bd create "New atom: [description]" -t atom -p 2
   bd dep add [new-atom-id] [current-id] --type discovered-from

   # Mark complete when done
   bd close [atom-id] --reason "Implemented with [N] tests passing"
   ```
   {{ELSE}}
   - Mark atom subtasks as `[x]` in `tasks.md`
   {{ENDIF tracking_mode_beads}}

6. **Handoff to Molecules**
   - Document what atoms are available
   - Note any atoms that were NOT implemented (and why)
   - Confirm all atom tests pass
   - **Checkpoint:** All atoms complete before molecule-composer starts

---

## Phase 2: Composition - Molecules

### Agent: `molecule-composer`

**Responsibility:** Compose 2-3 atoms into helpers, simple data structures, small services.

**Dependencies:** Requires atoms from Phase 1

**Workflow:**

1. **Verify Atom Availability**
   - Confirm all required atoms exist and tests pass
   - Review atom documentation/signatures

2. **Find Ready Work**
   {{IF tracking_mode_beads}}
   ```bash
   # Find unblocked molecule issues (atoms completed)
   bd ready --type molecule

   # Check discovered molecules
   bd list --discovered-from [completed-atom-id]
   ```
   {{ELSE}}
   - Read molecule-level subtasks from `tasks.md`
   {{ENDIF tracking_mode_beads}}

3. **Implement Molecules**
   - Compose ONLY atoms (no organism dependencies)
   - 2-3 atoms per molecule maximum
   - Single clear purpose per molecule
   - Place in appropriate location (e.g., `services/`, `lib/molecules/`, `helpers/`)
   - Examples: Auth helpers, data transformers, simple validators

4. **Write Tests** (2-5 per molecule)
   - Unit tests with minimal mocking
   - Test composition logic, not atom internals
   - Verify integration between atoms
   - Run tests: Ensure all pass

5. **Track Progress**
   {{IF tracking_mode_beads}}
   ```bash
   bd update [molecule-id] --status in_progress

   # Discover new molecules or atoms
   bd create "New molecule: [description]" -t molecule -p 2
   bd dep add [new-id] [current-id] --type discovered-from

   bd close [molecule-id] --reason "Implemented with [N] tests passing"
   ```
   {{ELSE}}
   - Mark molecule subtasks as `[x]` in `tasks.md`
   {{ENDIF tracking_mode_beads}}

6. **Handoff to Organisms**
   - Document available molecules and their APIs
   - Note composition patterns used
   - Confirm all molecule tests pass
   - **Checkpoint:** All molecules complete before organism builders start

---

## Handoff Protocols

Each agent must leave clear state for the next agent:

### Atom Writer → Molecule Composer
- List of atoms created
- Location of atom files
- Test results (all passing)
- Any atoms NOT implemented (with reason)

### Molecule Composer → Organism Builders
- List of molecules created
- APIs/signatures of molecules
- Composition patterns used
- Test results (all passing)

### Organism Builders → Test Gap Analyzer
- Total tests written per layer
- What was tested, what wasn't
- Known edge cases not covered
- Test results (all passing)

### Test Gap Analyzer → Integration Assembler
- Total test count (original + gap tests)
- What gaps were filled
- Full feature test suite results
- Any remaining known gaps (with justification)

### Integration Assembler → Verification Agent
- E2E flow test results
- Full project test suite results
- Screenshots of working feature
- Deployment readiness assessment

---

## Recovery from Errors

If any phase encounters blockers:

1. **DO NOT** skip to next phase
2. **DO NOT** mark tasks complete if tests failing
3. **DO** create discovered-from issues for unexpected work
4. **DO** document the blocker clearly
5. **DO** ask for help if truly stuck

{{IF tracking_mode_beads}}
```bash
# Create blocker issue
bd create "Blocker: [description]" -t bug -p 1 --status blocked

# Link to current work
bd dep add [current-id] [blocker-id] --type blocked-by
```
{{ENDIF tracking_mode_beads}}

---

## Success Criteria

✅ Bottom-up implementation: Atoms → Molecules → Organisms → Pages
✅ Each phase complete before next begins
✅ Dependencies flow downward only
✅ Tests written at appropriate level for each atomic unit
✅ Total test count reasonable (26-44 tests for full feature)
✅ All tests passing at each checkpoint
✅ Clear handoffs between agents
✅ Feature works end-to-end

This workflow ensures disciplined, composable, testable code built from atomic principles.
