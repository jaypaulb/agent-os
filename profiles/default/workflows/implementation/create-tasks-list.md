# Task List Creation

## Core Responsibilities

1. **Analyze spec and requirements**: Read and analyze the spec.md and/or requirements.md to inform the tasks list you will create.
2. **Plan task execution order**: Break the requirements into a list of tasks in an order that takes their dependencies into account.
3. **Group tasks by specialization**: Group tasks that require the same skill or stack specialization together (backend, api, ui design, etc.)
4. **Create Tasks list**: Create the markdown tasks list broken into groups with sub-tasks.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Analyze Spec & Requirements

Read each of these files (whichever are available) and analyze them to understand the requirements for this feature implementation:
- `.agent-os/specs/[this-spec]/spec.md`
- `.agent-os/specs/[this-spec]/planning/requirements.md`

Use your learnings to inform the tasks list and groupings you will create in the next step.


### Step 2: Create Tasks Breakdown

Generate `.agent-os/specs/[current-spec]/tasks.md`.

**Important**: The exact tasks, task groups, and organization will vary based on the feature's specific requirements. The following is an example format - adapt the content of the tasks list to match what THIS feature actually needs.

**Atomic Design Structure**: Organize tasks following atomic design hierarchy (atoms → molecules → organisms) and suggest appropriate agents for each task group.

## Execution Order

Recommended implementation sequence (follows atomic design dependency graph):
1. Atoms Layer (Task Group 1) - No dependencies
2. Molecules Layer (Task Group 2) - Depends on atoms
3. Database Organism Layer (Task Group 3) - Depends on molecules
4. API Organism Layer (Task Group 4) - Depends on database organisms
5. UI Organism Layer (Task Group 5) - Depends on API organisms
6. Molecule Testing (Task Group 6) - Depends on molecules
7. Organism Testing (Task Group 7) - Depends on organisms
8. Test Gap Analysis (Task Group 8) - Depends on all tests
9. Integration (Task Group 9) - Depends on all organisms + tests

**Agent Assignment:**
- Task Groups suggest specific agents (atom-writer, molecule-composer, etc.)
- Orchestration validates suggestions and can override if needed
- Minimal user input required
```

**Note**: Adapt this structure based on the actual feature requirements. Some features may need:
- Different task groups (e.g., email notifications, payment processing, data migration)
- Different execution order based on dependencies
- More or fewer sub-tasks per group

## Important Constraints

- **Create tasks that are specific and verifiable**
- **Group related tasks:** For example, group back-end engineering tasks together and front-end UI tasks together.
- **Limit test writing during development**:
  - Each task group (1-3) should write 2-8 focused tests maximum
  - Tests should cover only critical behaviors, not exhaustive coverage
  - Test verification should run ONLY the newly written tests, not the entire suite
  - If there is a dedicated test coverage group for filling in gaps in test coverage, this group should add only a maximum of 10 additional tests IF NECESSARY to fill critical gaps
- **Use a focused test-driven approach** where each task group starts with writing 2-8 tests (x.1 sub-task) and ends with running ONLY those tests (final sub-task)
- **Include acceptance criteria** for each task group
- **Reference visual assets** if visuals are available
